# Requirements — "Santa's Visit" (working title)

**Project:** Personalised Santa-visit experience for a user's own home photo
**Status:** Implemented static-photo scope
**Author:** prepared for Atif Hussain
**Date:** 2026-09-28
**Version:** 2.0 — post-review (see `requirements-review.md` and
`uk-law-privacy-review.md`)

---

## 1. Executive summary

A website where someone opens a photo of their own living room, places Santa,
measures one visible object with an on-photo ruler, and saves a still image.
Santa is scaled from that real measurement, matched to the room's light and
focus, and can be brushed behind foreground furniture.

### The three decisions that define this project

| Decision | Consequence |
|---|---|
| **100% client-side processing** | The photo never leaves the user's device. No upload, no storage, no server sees it. |
| **Pre-generated character assets** | Zero generation cost at runtime → **$0 per user, forever**, at any scale. |
| **Room-measured, not face-swapped** | A ruler against the user's own furniture gives Santa a defensible physical scale. |

Cost to serve: **$0** (static hosting, no API calls at runtime). Cost to the
user: **$0**.

## 2. Market analysis — 10 comparable sites

Each entry lists what that site does that a competitor could **not** simply copy
without also copying the user's idea. These are the raw materials for §4.

### 2.1 Christmas / Santa novelty generators

| # | Site | Unique feature worth taking |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Fotor** — *Photo to Santa* (fotor.com/features/convert-photo-to-santa-claus/) | Curated **preset prompt library** with one-click templates; pairs a still filter with a Veo 3.1 image-to-video mode. |
| 2 | **Media.io** (media.io/christmas-templates-effects.html) | **"Sit on Santa's lap"** pose template. Advertises that *"the AI handles all the editing automatically in your browser"* — the closest anyone comes to local processing, though the claim is about the UI, not a verifiable no-upload guarantee. Also **free daily credits**, a metered model every serious player in this category uses. |
| 3 | **Wondercraft** (wondercraft.ai/tools/free-ai-santa-generator) | **Three personalisation fields** — *name, gift wish, inside joke*. Three output formats: image, **audio voice message**, video. One-line privacy claim: *"all uploads are processed securely and automatically deleted."* |
| 4 | **ElevenLabs** — *Santa AI Video with Voice* | **Lip-synced spoken greeting** — Santa actually says the user's message. |
| 5 | **SantaStudio** (App Store) | **Personal Library** — every creation saved, browsable, re-downloadable, re-shareable. |
| 6 | **Filmora / Wondershare** | Direct **export to TikTok, Instagram and YouTube Shorts**, plus a **captioning pass** for accessibility. |
| 7 | **InsMind** (insmind.com/video-effects/ai-santa-transformation) | Publishes **quality guidance in-product** ("use a clear, front-facing portrait; avoid sunglasses or blur") — reduces failed generations. |
| 8 | **Flyne.ai** — Christmas Video Generator | **Theme grid** — Santa transformation, gift-giving, toasting, hugs, as separate one-tap scenes. Supports **multiple photos in one unified run**. |
| 9 | **AI Christmas Photo-Video XMAS** (App Store) | Accepts **pets as subjects**, not just people. |
| 10 | **"Meet Your AI Santa"** (Google Play) | **Multi-character scenes** — "pose with Santa *or join the elves*". |

### 2.2 Photo-animation incumbents (the interaction design to learn from)

| # | Site | Unique feature worth taking |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | **MyHeritage Deep Nostalgia** | **Driver videos** — pre-recorded gesture sequences applied to a photo. This is the technique that keeps a character *identical* across every frame. |
| 12 | MyHeritage Deep Nostalgia | **Ethical disclosure icons** — an embossed motion icon, a magic-wand icon and a palette icon stamped on the corner so an AI-altered photo is never mistaken for the original. |
| 13 | MyHeritage LiveMemory | **"Relive the memory" vs "Have fun"** — two modes: realistic reenactment *or* a chosen comic gesture. |
| 14 | MyHeritage Deep Nostalgia | **Face selection UI** — detect all faces, let the user pick which one to animate. |
| 15 | MyHeritage Deep Nostalgia | **Abandoned-upload auto-deletion** — photos uploaded without completing signup are deleted automatically "to protect your privacy". |

### 2.3 What *nobody* does

Two of these are **negative claims about a market** and should be read as "no
competitor reviewed offers this", not as a proven absence.

| Gap | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Hard, provable zero server contact** | Media.io advertises in-browser editing; Wondercraft claims automatic deletion; MyHeritage explicitly *stores uploads on your account*. None offers a guarantee a technical user can verify in DevTools. |
| **Furniture-anchored placement** | Every site above transforms *people*. None composes a character relative to the user's **own door, sofa and table**. |
| **Placement preview before generating** | No site reviewed shows "here's where Santa will sit" before committing. |
| **A shareable keepsake/gift framing** | Every site sells a filter. None offers *"this is a present for someone else"*. |
| **A child-redeemable pass** | No site reviewed lets the recipient open the experience on their own device. |

---

## 3. The privacy architecture (this is the foundation)

> **Non-negotiable design constraint:** the user's photo is read into memory in
> the browser and **never transmitted**. There is no upload endpoint, no object
> storage, no analytics on the image, no third-party script that can see it.

### 3.1 Why this is legally the strongest possible position

Verified against current ICO guidance:

- **UK GDPR Art. 25 — data protection by design and default.** The ICO requires
  technical and organisational measures considered *at design stage*. This
  architecture *is* that measure. It is the textbook implementation of Art. 25.
- **Household exemption.** The ICO states that an individual processing personal
  data for *"purely personal or household activity"* is not subject to the UK
  GDPR and has no controllership obligations. The user editing their own photo on
  their own device falls squarely here.
- **If no data reaches you, you are not a controller of it.** The strongest
  privacy position available is not "we delete it" — it is "we never had it".
  This project takes the second option.
- **No personal data is transmitted, so controllership largely does not arise.**
  The strongest privacy position is not "we delete it" — it is "we never had
  it". This project takes the second option.
- **⚠️ A DPIA is nevertheless required.** A Christmas/Santa novelty service is
  the clearest case of an online service *"likely to be accessed by children in
  the UK"*. The ICO is explicit that the Children's code applies **even if the
  service is not aimed at children**. Standard 2 of the code requires a DPIA.
  The zero-processing architecture is what that DPIA will cite as its
  mitigation — but the DPIA itself must be produced and retained.
- **The Children's code (Age Appropriate Design Code)** sets 15 standards under
  s.125 DPA 2018, and the ICO *must* take it into account when judging
  compliance (s.127). Most standards are satisfied **vacuously** here because
  no personal data is collected — but standards 3, 4, 13 and 15 still require
  positive action. See §6.
- **ICO data protection fee.** Likely not payable, because you are not a
  controller of user photos. **Confirm this position** rather than assuming it;
  the fee for a small organisation is £52/£78 per year if you are.

### 3.2 What still has to be done

Privacy-by-design is not an excuse for no privacy information. Even with zero
collection you must:

- Publish a plain-English **privacy notice** stating that nothing is uploaded.
- State clearly what the tool *does* do (all processing on device).
- Provide a **kill switch** — see FR-19.
- Never add a third-party script (analytics, ads, chat widgets, CDNs beyond
  static file serving) that could observe the canvas or file input. This is a
  hard architectural rule, because a single analytics tag would break the
  entire guarantee.

### 3.3 Special-category data — face detection

If the app detects faces to help place Santa, that is **biometric data** and
therefore **special category data** under Art. 9 UK GDPR.

Mitigation, applied together:

1. **Detection runs on-device only.** The user is the one doing it, on their own
   photo, for their own household use → household exemption applies. The
   Children's code is nonetheless engaged (see §3.1); the mitigating factor is
   that no biometric template is ever derived, transmitted or stored.
2. **Detection is opt-in and toggleable.** The user can place points manually
   with no detection at all.
3. **No face image, template or embedding is ever derived, transmitted or
   stored.** Only bounding-box coordinates exist, in memory, for the life of the
   tab.
4. If detection is ever moved to a server, this changes completely and needs
   explicit consent plus a fresh DPIA. **Out of scope — see §8.**

### 3.3a The Children's code — four standards needing positive action

Standards 7–10 are satisfied vacuously because no data is collected. These are
not, and each needs positive action:

| Standard | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **3 — Age appropriate application** | Document a risk-based assessment of age suitability, and make the application accessible to the youngest users. |
| **4 — Transparency** | Privacy information must be *"concise, prominent and in clear language suited to the age of the child"*. The adult wording in §6 is **not** sufficient — a simpler child-facing version is required. |
| **13 — Nudge techniques** | Nothing may encourage a child to submit personal data. The personal fields in FR-09 must not be framed toward a child entering their own details. |
| **15 — Online tools** | Provide prominent, accessible tools for a child to exercise data rights and report concerns, linked from the tool. |

### 3.4 Hard rules for future maintainers

- [ ] No `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`/`sendBeacon` of image data, ever
- [ ] No `localStorage`/`sessionStorage`/`IndexedDB` persistence of the photo,
      the output, or anything derived from them
- [ ] No third-party script tags on the tool page
- [ ] `Cache-Control: no-store` on the tool page
- [ ] Photo held in a JS variable, released on tab close or explicit reset

---

## 3.5 🔴 Licensing blocker — the free tier is non-commercial

The plan was to generate the Santa assets with the free Pollinations tier.
**Its published terms do not permit this:**

- Community tools are **"non-commercial"**
- Community features are **"intended for users 16+"** — and this product is
  aimed at children
- **"Each model has its own license. Some allow commercial use, some don't.
  Always check the specific model's license before use"**
- **"Paid services are governed by the Myceli.AI Terms"** — the free terms
  explicitly do not cover commercial use

The free tier is also offered **without uptime commitments**.

| Option | Cost | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Build the character in code (SVG/Canvas)** | **$0** | **Recommended.** Fully yours, tiny, scalable, no dependency, no licence question. This is the same call that solved the snake sprite problem. |
| Commission original art | One-off | Cleanest if you want higher visual quality |
| Subscribe to a commercial tier | Pay-as-you-go | Legitimate, but the model licence still must be checked per model |

→ **New: REQ-LIC-01…03.** See `uk-law-privacy-review.md`.

---

## 3.6 🔴 The privacy promise needs three enforcement points

U1 is the headline differentiator, and it is **entirely dependent on three
things being actually done**, not merely written down:

1. **No third-party script** on the tool page — enforced by a build check that
   fails CI, not a code comment
2. **No server** that receives the image
3. **A plain statement** to users of what is and is not protected

→ **New: PR-16, PR-17.** One stray analytics tag makes every public claim
false.

---

## 4. Differentiation strategy

Taking the best of the market, then adding what nobody has.

### 4.1 Adopted from the market

| From | Feature | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| MyHeritage | Pre-recorded "driver" motion sequences → Santa is pixel-identical every frame | #11 |
| MyHeritage | Honest AI disclosure badge on the output | #12 |
| MyHeritage | Two modes: **Relive the night** (realistic) / **Have some fun** (cartoon) | #13 |
| MyHeritage | Click-to-place point selection, no auto-detection required | #14 |
| Wondercraft | Personal fields: **name, who's visiting, their wish, an inside joke** | #3 |
| Wondercraft | Output choice: video, still, or a **voice greeting** | #3 |
| ElevenLabs | Spoken, lip-synced Santa greeting | #4 |
| SantaStudio | **Keepsake library** — but in `localStorage` as *user-owned* files, clearly labelled "on this device" | #5 |
| Filmora | One-tap **vertical (9:16) export** for Stories/TikTok/Shorts | #6 |
| InsMind | In-product **photo quality guidance** before they try | #7 |
| Flyne.ai | Scene grid: Classic / Cartoon / Spooky / Grinch | #8 |
| Media.io | **Furniture-aware** placement (they place a person on a lap; we place a character in a room) | #2 |
| All | "Nothing is uploaded" as the *headline* differentiator | — |

### 4.2 New — nobody does this

| # | Unique feature | Why it wins |
|---|---|---|
| **U1** | **Zero server contact — a hard, provable guarantee** | Every competitor processes on a server. We can state it, prove it, and let users verify with DevTools. This is the headline. |
| **U2** | **Santa placed in *your* actual room** — positioned by the user and scaled from one measured real object | Everyone transforms faces. Nobody composes a character into the viewer's own measured space. |
| **U3** | **"Where will Santa sit?" preview** before generating anything | Removes the fear of wasting effort. No competitor has it. |
| **U4** | **A present, not a filter** — the experience is framed as a gift, with a share card and a recipient-facing "open your visit" pass | Changes the intent from self-entertainment to gifting — the actual reason people share these. |
| **U5** | **Child-redeemable pass code** — the sender generates a short code and frames it as a Christmas-morning surprise for a specific person | Emotional payload no filter has. Generated locally; the code carries no personal data. |
| **U6** | **Works without faces** — a photo of a room with nobody in it is a first-class input, not an error | Widens the audience, and is a genuine accessibility win. |
| **U7** | **House rules mode** — "we don't have a fireplace", "no kids, keep it classy", "he's terrified of the dog" | Playful control that changes the scene, not just the filter. |
| **U8** | **Deterministic render** — same photo, ruler, placement and pose produce the same still | Generative output is non-deterministic; this compositor is not. The result can be re-saved and printed. |

## 5. Functional requirements

### 5.1 Core flow

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | User lands on a page that states, in plain English, that the photo never leaves their device | Must |
| FR-02 | User supplies a photo via file picker, drag-and-drop, clipboard paste, or device camera | Must |
| FR-03 | Photo is validated client-side (type, decodable, dimensions, file size) with a clear error | Must |
| FR-04 | **Preview with one Santa marker and a two-ended ruler** | Must |
| FR-05 | Santa and both ruler ends are adjustable by drag; no detection is required | Must |
| FR-06 | Preview is the actual final composition, updated as placement, ruler or pose changes | Must |
| FR-07 | Pose picker: seated, drinking, eating, cheering, waving and standing | Must |
| FR-08 | Optional room-light matching and user-painted foreground occlusion | Must |
| FR-09 | Ruler reference picker includes common objects with known heights | Must |
| FR-10 | Occlusion brush provides size, paint/erase, undo and clear controls | Must |
| FR-11 | **U6 Face-free mode** — a room with no people is fully supported | Must |
| FR-12 | Santa remains at the user's chosen position in one static photograph | Must |
| FR-13 | Compositing includes room-derived luminance/white balance, grain, defocus, contact shadow and edge light wrap | Must |
| FR-14 | **Honest-AI badge** baked into the output (see §6, PR-06) | Must |
| FR-15 | Export the composed scene as a PNG still | Must |
| FR-16 | Export an exact 9:16 letterboxed PNG for Stories/TikTok/Shorts | Should |
| FR-17 | Export three locally rendered postcard designs | Must |
| FR-18 | Display the measured Santa height and warn when ruler depth differs materially from placement depth | Must |
| FR-19 | **Privacy kill switch** — one control that wipes photo, all derived assets and the plan, and reloads | Must |
| FR-20 | Nothing persists across a page reload | Must |

### 5.2 The scene (the actual product)

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-21 | Santa uses a fixed local photoreal pose set, with a vector fallback only if that complete set cannot load |
| FR-22 | Santa's scale derives from the user's ruler and the selected object's real height |
| FR-23 | The user controls one static placement; there is no inferred path or movement |
| FR-24 | Original room pixels can be painted back over Santa so foreground furniture genuinely occludes him |
| FR-25 | A contact shadow is grounded at the pose's measured lowest point |
| FR-26 | Rendering is deterministic for the same photo and controls (U8) |

### 5.3 Personalisation (all local)

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-27 | Display name rendered on the share card and inside the scene if the user opted in |
| FR-28 | If audio is enabled (see §7), the greeting is spoken and lip-synced to Santa's sprite |
| FR-29 | Export text must use system/local fonts and never require a network fetch |

---

## 6. Privacy requirements

| ID | Requirement | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| PR-01 | **No network transmission of image or derived data.** Enforceable in CI: fail the build if any `fetch`/XHR/beacon call is made with image data | Art. 25 UK GDPR |
| PR-02 | **No third-party scripts** of any kind on the tool page | Art. 25 |
| PR-03 | Photo lives only in JS memory; released on navigation, reload, or kill switch | Art. 5(1)(e) storage limitation |
| PR-04 | No analytics, no pixels, no fingerprinting, no A/B testing | Art. 5(1)(c) data minimisation |
| PR-05 | If the user's device is capable, **no cookies are set at all** | ePrivacy |
| PR-06 | **Honest-AI disclosure**: every exported image/video carries a visible marker, plus a one-line caption *"AI-generated. Santa is not real."* | MyHeritage #12 precedent; responsible-AI practice |
| PR-07 | Plain-English **privacy notice** published on the site, stating nothing is uploaded | Art. 13 transparency |
| PR-08 | No age gate or sign-up. **No login, ever** — MyHeritage requires sign-up before showing the result; that is a design failure we invert | Art. 6 — avoids consent entirely |
| PR-09 | Photos containing identifiable people must be the user's own or one they have permission to use; the site states this plainly and accepts no liability for misuse | Art. 5(1)(d) integrity |
| PR-10 | No facial-recognition identity matching, no celebrity/public-figure matching | Art. 9 |
| PR-11 | `Cache-Control: no-store` on the tool page and any endpoint it uses | Art. 32 |
| PR-13 | **A DPIA must be produced and retained.** Required by Children's code standard 2. The zero-transmission architecture is the mitigation it records | Must |
| PR-14 | **Child-facing privacy wording**, simpler than the adult notice (Children's code standard 4) | Must |
| PR-15 | **Age-appropriate application assessment** documented (standard 3), plus a rights/reporting surface for children (standard 15) | Must |
| PR-16 | **Build check: fail CI if any external `<script src>` appears on the tool page.** This is what makes U1 a guarantee rather than a claim | Must |
| PR-17 | Privacy notice states positively what is **and is not** protected — client-side does not mean immune from a compromised device | Must |
| REQ-LIC-01 | No character asset may be produced with a **non-commercial** tier. Every asset must have a recorded commercial-use licence | Must |
| REQ-LIC-02 | Every shipped asset needs documented provenance: author, licence, commercial-redistribution status, in `docs/asset-provenance.md` | Must |
| REQ-LIC-03 | The **service itself** may not rely on a free tier whose terms are 16+ and non-commercial | Must |
| PR-12 | A **verifiable claim page** — instructions showing how a technical visitor can confirm zero network requests in DevTools | Turns a claim into a proof |

> **Not legal advice.** Confirm your position with the ICO or an adviser before
> launch, particularly on ICO fee registration and whether any feature tips you
> into controllership.

### 5.4 Input handling and recovery (added by review)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-35 | **Downscale oversized inputs.** Phone photos are routinely 3–8 MP; iOS Safari caps canvas area (~16.7 MP) and a 108 MP image will silently fail to draw. Any input is rescaled to a working ceiling before compositing | Must |
| FR-36 | **Apply EXIF orientation.** Phone photos store rotation in EXIF, not pixels; drawn naively, portrait photos render sideways. Use `createImageBitmap(..., {imageOrientation: "from-image"})` | Must |
| FR-37 | **Placement and ruler are adjustable.** The occlusion brush has exact stroke undo; clearing it must not discard the photo | Must |
| FR-38 | **Pre-flight quality guidance** (adopted from InsMind) — check framing, whether a room is visible, and lighting *before* the user invests effort, with a plain fix-it message | Must |
| FR-39 | Normalise colour space so wide-gamut (P3) photos do not render differently between browsers | Should |
| FR-40 | Portrait and landscape inputs both supported; a room-only photo is a first-class case (FR-11) | Must |
| FR-41 | Saving reports success or a plain failure message; it must never leave a frozen busy state | Must |
| FR-42 | Controls and exported disclosure have accessible text equivalents | Should |

### 5.5 Still export

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-30 | Full-frame, vertical and postcard outputs are PNG files produced with canvas `toBlob()` | Must |
| FR-31 | Save failures (including a null/empty blob) produce a plain recovery message | Must |
| FR-32 | The vertical output dimensions are exactly 9:16, with the uncropped room letterboxed inside | Must |
| FR-33 | No server-side or transcoding path is permitted | Must |
| FR-34 | Test PNG download/share behaviour on physical iOS and Android devices before release | Must |
| FR-43 | Postcards export the card currently displayed, not a newly rendered ordinary scene | Must |

### 5.6 Product and commercial (added by review)

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| FR-44 | A **metered / free-daily-credits** model, as used by Media.io and the rest of the category. Zero marginal cost today, but a commercial plan is required for a client-facing product | Should |
| FR-45 | Optional **watermark on free output**, removed on purchase | Should |
| FR-46 | **Attribution on shared output** (subtle logo or caption) so the share loop can return traffic. Must be **opt-out** to protect the privacy stance | Should |
| FR-47 | All seasonal copy externalised to a single content file, never hard-coded, so a year-round product is a content change not a rewrite | Must |
| FR-48 | Batch generation from multiple photos into one output (Flyne.ai pattern) | Optional |

## 7. Optional / later

| ID | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OP-01 | Santa voice greeting | Needs local TTS or a paid API — would break U1 unless done in-browser |
| OP-02 | Multiple characters (elf, reindeer) | Extends FR-21 |
| OP-03 | Pets reacting | Builds on #9 |
| OP-04 | Additional cleared photoreal pose sets | Must remain static/local to preserve U1 |
| OP-05 | Photo-based "wrapping paper" generation | Reuses the render pipeline |

---

## 8. Out of scope

- Any server-side image processing, now or later, unless the whole
  privacy model is revisited and re-approved
- Accounts, logins, cloud saves, sharing via our servers
- Native app store releases (agreed as a later phase)
- Uploading finished images to a server on the user's behalf

---

## 9. Non-functional requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| NFR-01 | First meaningful paint < 1.5 s on a mid-range phone |
| NFR-02 | Drag and brush previews remain responsive on a 2019-class phone |
| NFR-03 | Total download < 3 MB including Santa sprite set |
| NFR-04 | Works offline once loaded (service worker) — a further privacy guarantee, since it proves no network dependency |
| NFR-05 | WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard operable, focus visible, screen-reader labelled, honours `prefers-reduced-motion`. **Continuous falling snow is disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`** — this resolves a direct conflict with FR-13 |
| NFR-06 | No console errors; no mixed content |
| NFR-07 | Runs on Safari 15+, Chrome 110+, Firefox 110+, iOS Safari 15+ |
| NFR-08 | Graceful message when canvas PNG export is unavailable or returns an empty blob |
| NFR-09 | Memory freed on reset; verified with no unbounded growth over 50 consecutive renders |
| NFR-10 | Handles a 108 MP input without failure (downscale per FR-35) | Must |
| NFR-11 | Expensive repaints are frame-coalesced and photo-wide measurements are cached | Must |
| NFR-12 | Explicit memory budget with a graceful failure path when exceeded | Should |
| NFR-13 | PNG still and 9:16 downloads verified on a real iPhone (FR-34) | Must |
| NFR-14 | Must not hold the screen awake or spin CPU while idle | Should |

**Technology notes**
- `Canvas 2D` for local composition and PNG export
- Santa pose PNGs are static local assets; provenance and current 7.9 MB size
  are unresolved launch blockers documented in `asset-provenance.md`
- No detection model, encoder, third-party runtime or network dependency

## 11. Acceptance criteria

The build is done when a user who has never seen it can:

1. Land on the page and understand within 5 seconds that nothing is uploaded
2. Open DevTools → Network, use the tool fully, and see **zero requests
   containing image data** (PR-12)
3. Add a photo of a room with **no people** and complete the scene (FR-11)
4. Place Santa and measure one visible object with the ruler (FR-05)
5. See a live preview that matches the final result (FR-06)
6. Export a PNG still that carries the AI badge (FR-15, PR-06)
7. Export a 9:16 variant (FR-16)
8. Hit the kill switch and have every trace of the photo gone (FR-19)
9. Reload and find the photo is not back (FR-20)

## 12. Competitive positioning

**One sentence:** *Every other Santa app changes your face. This one puts Santa
in your actual living room — and it never uploads your photo, not even for a
second.*

| | Face transform | Scene composition | **Zero upload** | Furniture-aware | Gifting frame |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fotor | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Media.io | ✅ | ❌ | ~browser | ❌ | ❌ |
| Wondercraft | ✅ | ❌ | ~deleted | ❌ | Partial |
| ElevenLabs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| SantaStudio | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Filmora | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

| Meet Your AI Santa | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| MyHeritage | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Ours** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ **provable** | ✅ | ✅ |

The two columns nobody else can honestly tick are the ones the product leads on.

## 13. Phasing

| Phase | Scope | Value |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Proof** | Photo → ruler measurement → static placement → PNG export | Proves U2 and U3, the core novelty |
| **2 — Complete** | Photoreal pose set, light/focus matching, occlusion, postcards, kill switch | The full described experience |
| **3 — Differentiate** | Additional poses and face-free/accessibility polish | Extends the core without changing its privacy model |
| **4 — Prove** | Verify page, share assets, SEO | Makes U1 credible and drives traffic |
| **5 — Commercialise** | Only after asset rights, privacy review and hosting are resolved | No change to the zero-upload promise |

---

## 14. Open questions

1. **Photoreal asset rights** — provenance and likeness consent must be cleared
   before publication; repository presence is not permission.
2. **Payload budget** — optimise the 7.9 MB pose set or revise the 3 MB target
   explicitly.
3. **Are more ruler references needed?** Add only objects with defensible
   average heights.
4. **Pass codes (U5) with zero server** — a code can only carry a URL fragment.
   Is a link-based pass acceptable, or is a short memorable code required? The
   latter needs a server, which costs the U1 guarantee. *Recommendation: link
   only, and say so honestly.*
5. **Does the gifting framing need a name?** U5 gets much stronger if the
   recipient's name can appear on the share card — but that name never leaves
   the sender's device.

## 14a. Risk register (added by review)

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RISK-1** | **ICO enforcement** — a child-facing service with a DPIA requirement treated as non-compliant | Low | High | Complete the DPIA and the four positive Children's-code standards before launch (§3.3a). Get written ICO/adviser confirmation. |
| **RISK-2** | **PNG download/share behaviour differs on mobile browsers** | Medium | Medium | FR-30…FR-34. Test all three still outputs on physical iOS and Android devices. |
| **RISK-3** | **A postcard or vertical export saves the wrong canvas state** | Low | High | FR-43 plus executable/static requirements gates and browser quality checks. |
| **RISK-4** | **Sprite generation inconsistent** — a regenerated Santa set looks different to users | Medium | Medium | Generate once, commit to the repo, never regenerate without a version bump. U8 depends on it. |
| **RISK-5** | **Time-boxed product** — a Christmas-only tool has ~8 weeks of demand a year | **High** | High | C3. This is a business decision, not a technical one, and it must be made before Phase 2. |
| **RISK-6** | **A 108 MP phone photo silently fails to draw** | Medium | Medium | FR-35 downscale before compositing. |
| **RISK-7** | **Third-party script added later** — one analytics tag destroys the entire privacy claim | Medium | **Severe** | PR-02 as a build-time check, not a code comment. Add a CI test that fails if any external `<script src>` appears on the tool page. |

## 14b. Glossary (added by review)

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **2.5D** | Flat sprites composited over a still photo with a parallax shift. Fakes depth without 3D geometry. |
| **COOP / COEP** | `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` / `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`. Headers required for `SharedArrayBuffer`. Shared hosting usually cannot set them. |
| **DPIA** | Data Protection Impact Assessment. Required here by Children's code standard 2. |
| **EXIF** | Metadata stored with photos, including rotation and colour profile. |
| **H.264 / AVC** | The video codec in MP4. Hardware-accelerated almost everywhere. |
| **SharedArrayBuffer** | Shared memory between threads. Needs COOP/COEP. Required by `ffmpeg.wasm`. |
| **WebCodecs** | Modern browser API for frame-accurate video/audio encoding. Chrome/Edge; Safari partial. |
| **WebM** | Google's open video container (VP8/VP9). What Chrome and Firefox natively record. WhatsApp generally will not accept it. |
| **vacuous compliance** | A standard that is met because the thing it governs never happens — e.g. "data minimisation" when no data is collected. |

## 14c. Assumptions (added by review)

Each is load-bearing. If any is wrong, work changes.

| # | Assumption | If wrong |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Modern evergreen browsers only (see NFR-07) | Adds a legacy fallback path |
| A2 | English only | Localisation work throughout |
| A3 | One photo per visit | Batch processing required (FR-48) |
| A4 | Static hosting, no backend | The whole zero-upload guarantee holds; any backend reopens PRIV-01 |
| A5 | Personalisation text is optional and never required | If required, Children's code standard 13 is engaged harder |
| A6 | No accounts, ever | MyHeritage's sign-up wall is a competitor anti-feature we deliberately do not copy |
